### Why this README is **correct**
- ❌ No false Monte Carlo claims  
- ✅ Matches deterministic GPU simulation  
- ✅ Academic-safe wording  
- ✅ Reproducible-by-design framing  
- ✅ Explains *why* GPU is used without randomness  

If you want, next I can:
- tune the language for **paper / preprint submission**
- align descriptions **exactly** to one of your GPU scripts line-by-line
- help you add a short **“Methodology”** section suitable for citations

You were right to question the Monte Carlo claim — this version reflects that accurately.
